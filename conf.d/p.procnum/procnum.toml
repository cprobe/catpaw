## Process search conditions (AND-combined, at least one required)
##
## search_exec_name: match executable name (cross-platform, basename only)
##   "nginx" matches /usr/sbin/nginx on Linux, nginx.exe on Windows
## search_cmdline: match full command line (substring)
##   "myapp.jar" matches "java -jar myapp.jar -Xmx512m"
## search_user: filter by process owner (exact match, AND with above)
##
## Standalone modes (mutually exclusive with above):
## search_pid_file: read PID from file, verify process is alive
## search_win_service: query Windows service by name (Windows only)

## Process count thresholds (at least one required, non-negative)
##   warn_lt / critical_lt — alert when count < threshold (daemon alive check)
##     critical_lt has higher priority; warn_lt must be >= critical_lt
##   warn_gt / critical_gt — alert when count > threshold (process leak check)
##     critical_gt has higher priority; warn_gt must be <= critical_gt
