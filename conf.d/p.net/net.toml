## NOTE: because the "udp" protocol does not respond to requests, it requires
## a send/expect string pair (see below).

## The following options are required for UDP checks. For TCP, they are
## optional. The plugin will send the given string to the server and then
## expect to receive the given 'expect' string back.
## string sent to the server
# send = "ssh"
## expected string in answer
# expect = "ssh"
